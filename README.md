## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [VS-Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### What I learned
For this project I learned a lot! This was my first, hands-on project where I was given space to really explore the many ways of creating and designing a recipie page from nothing. I used this opportunity to get familiar with VS code, HTML, and CSS usage. Through that, I learned about the importance of using class features over ID, css edits, and much more. Below are a few snippits of what I was impressed by:

```html
    <div style="border-top: 1px solid black;"></div>
      <h2 class="bold-content">Preperation Time </h2>
```
```css
.main-heading {

    color:var(--neutral-DarckCharcoal) ;
    font-family:var(--Heading) ;
    font-weight:var(--Heading-Weight) ;
    font-size: calc(var(--Content-font-size)* 2);
    text-shadow: 4px 4px 3px rgb(221, 159, 208)
}

.bold-content {
    color: var(--primary-Nutmeg);
    font-size: calc(var(--Content-font-size) * 1.25);
    font-family: var(--Heading);
    text-shadow: 4px 4px 3px rgb(221, 159, 208)
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue to focus on front-end development using html and css through VS studios so that I can learn more about the many different ways I can create new things!
